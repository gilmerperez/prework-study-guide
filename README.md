# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- My motivation for this project was for me to create a very basic webpage that includede some details about the technologies that I would be using for    this project, for example I used basic HTML, CSS, and some JavaScripts variables and functions to lay a basic message for the future of what I would learn throughout this course.
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.") I built this project so that I would have a place to come backt o and add notes about the various new technologies that I would be using in this course, as well as different tips and thjings to remember when using them.
- This solved the problem of me needing to go back to multiple different places to see what I have used and how it has affected my time working on this bootcamp
- I learned a few things. Firstly I learned about what makes up a developer's mindset as well as the things that I need to thjink about and how to structure my learning so it is as efficient as possible. I also learned some very basic things aboout HTML as how to structure things on a webpage and how to use syntax. I also learned some CSS to style the webpage and add some color, indentations and boxes and shadows. I also learned how to use version control Git and it's user interface, GitHub to be able to deploy and test out my projects through this course. Some basic JavaScript was also taught so that I know what functions are and how to name and assign variables. I also learned how to use some features of GitHub to finally publish my project or repo online for the whole world to see.
