# Prework Study Guide

## Project Overview

The Prework Study Guide is a simple webpage designed to document and organize the technologies and concepts learned during the prework phase of a coding bootcamp. This project serves as a centralized resource for tracking key topics such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git, while also providing a foundation for future learning.

The primary motivation behind this project was to create a structured space where I could consolidate my notes and reflections on the technologies introduced during the prework. By building this webpage, I aimed to solve the problem of scattered resources and provide a single, accessible reference point for reviewing and expanding my knowledge.

This project was developed using basic web development technologies, including HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity. It also incorporates Git version control and GitHub for deployment, offering a hands-on introduction to essential tools and workflows in software development. Through this project, I gained foundational skills in web development, learned to think like a developer, and established a framework for efficient learning and documentation.
